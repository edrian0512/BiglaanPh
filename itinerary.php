          The word “damili” translates to “the art of pottery making” in the
          Ilocano language and is the root word for the name Red Clay
          Pagdamilian, a popular pottery studio and shop that showcases local
          talent with beautiful pottery and other souvenir items for sale. But
          more than the pottery on display, what makes it a popular attraction
          is that for a small fee, anyone can handle the clay and mold their
          very own one-of-a-kind souvenir clay item from scratch.
          <br />
          <br />
          The hands-on pottery lesson for visitors is such a big hit that it
          became the focal point of the shop, with local and foreign visitors
          flocking to the studio to create their own vessels and other pottery
          designs. It became a venue for visitors to release their artistic
          talents or a a creative outlet for participants to express their
          personality. <br />
          <br />
          The clay can be molded into useful shapes with a practical purposes or
          into decorative items to be displayed around the house such as clay
          pots, food storage, and mugs, to name a few. The pottery and souvenir
          shop can be found along the National Highway on Barangay La Union.

          Urbiztondo Beach in San Juan is known as the Surfing Capital of
          Northern Philippines, with surfing seasons typically falling July to
          October and November to March. This area of La Union has a reputation

          found throughout the coastline.<br /><br />
          Surfboards are available for rent throughout the area as well.
          Beginners typically start having lessons in Bacnotan because the waves
          in the area are not too big, which is perfect for novice learners or
          anyone who have never tried surfing before. The more advanced surfers
          usually go to Urbiztondo and the neighboring town of Mona Lisa Point.
          Restaurants offering local and international fare along with shops
          selling local handicrafts and souvenir items are also nearby.<br /><br />
          Urbiztondo has a great selection of restaurants, with cuisines ranging
          from Filipino delicacies, comfort food, Mexican, Asian, and Italian
          food. With its laidback vibe and artistic flair, local and foreign
          visitors have been coming back to Urbiztondo every year to enjoy the
          beach life.
